Your task is to perform \"per-timestep normalization\" by subtracting the mean value of each 2D slice (at each timestep) from that slice. You must do this without using any explicit loops.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1.  Create a random 3D NumPy array called `dataset` of shape `(10, 5, 5)` with integer values between 0 and 100.\n2.  Calculate the mean of each 2D slice along `axis=(1, 2)`. This will result in a 1D array of shape `(10,)` containing 10 mean values.\n3.  Use broadcasting with `np.newaxis` to subtract the corresponding mean from each 2D slice in the original `dataset`.\n4.  Print the shape of your calculated means array and the shape of the final normalized dataset to verify the operation.",

The data contains some noise and invalid values. Your goal is to clean it by clipping outliers and removing negative sensor errors.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1.  Create a random 4D NumPy array named `image_batch` of shape `(2, 10, 10, 3)`. Populate it with integers from -20 to 120.\n2.  Create a boolean mask to identify all values that are \"outliers\" (less than 0 or greater than 100).\n3.  Use the mask to **clip** the data: set all values greater than 100 to `100`, and all values less than 0 to `0`. (Hint: You can do this with two separate masks or one combined operation).\n4.  Finally, create another mask to find all values that are exactly `0` and replace them with `-1` to indicate they were corrected values.\n5.  Print the array after clipping and after the final replacement.",

Use `np.meshgrid` to create 2D coordinate grids `X` and `Y`.\n3.  Calculate a 2D array `R` representing the distance of each point `(X, Y)` from the origin `(0, 0)`. The formula is $R = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$. This calculation will rely on broadcasting.\n4.  Create a new array `target_mask` of the same shape as `R`, initialized with zeros.\n5.  Use **masked indexing** with logical operators to set the elements of `target_mask` to `1` where `R` is between an inner radius of 2.0 and an outer radius of 4.0 (i.e., `2.0 < R < 4.0`).\n6.

Create a 3D array `raw_data` of shape `(50, 8, 3)` with random float values from -1.0 to 10.0. This represents 50 timesteps for 8 sensors, with 3 measurements each.\n2.  **Broadcasting:** Create a 1D `calibration_factors` array of shape `(8,)` with random values. Multiply `raw_data` by these factors. Each sensor's data across all timesteps and measurements should be multiplied by its corresponding factor. You will need to use `np.newaxis` to align the arrays for broadcasting. Store the result in `calibrated_data`.\n3.  **Masked Indexing:** In `calibrated_data`, any negative values are considered errors. Use a boolean mask to replace all negative values with `0`.\n4.  **Special Indexing:** You are given a list of critical sensors, `critical_sensors = np.array([1, 3, 7])`. Use this array to extract all data (all timesteps and all measurements) for only these sensors. Store this in `final_data`.\n5.
