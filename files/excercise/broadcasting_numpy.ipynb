Your task is to perform \"per-timestep normalization\" by subtracting the mean value of each 2D slice (at each timestep) from that slice. You must do this without using any explicit loops.\n\n# Your Task:\n\n# Create a random 3D NumPy array called dataset of shape (10, 5, 5) with integer values between 0 and 100.\n# Calculate the mean of each 2D slice along axis=(1, 2). This will result in a 1D array of shape (10,) containing 10 mean values.\n# Use broadcasting with np.newaxis to subtract the corresponding mean from each 2D slice in the original dataset.\n# Print the shape of your calculated means array and the shape of the final normalized dataset to verify the operation.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Create random 3D dataset (10 timesteps, 5x5 sensor readings)\ndataset = np.random.randint(0, 101, size=(10, 5, 5))\nprint(\"Original dataset shape:\", dataset.shape)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate mean of each 2D slice (per timestep)\nmeans = dataset.mean(axis=(1, 2))   # shape (10,)\nprint(\"Means shape:\", means.shape)\nprint(\"Means:\", means)\n\n# Step 3: Normalize each 2D slice by subtracting its mean\n# Use broadcasting: reshape means to (10, 1, 1) so it matches (10, 5, 5)\nnormalized_dataset = dataset - means[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]\n\nprint(\"Normalized dataset shape:\", normalized_dataset.shape)\n\n# Optional: verify mean ~ 0 for each slice\nprint(\"Means after normalization:\", normalized_dataset.mean(axis=(1, 2)))\n\n\n\n\n\n# dataset.shape = (10, 5, 5) → 10 timesteps, each a 5×5 matrix.\n\n# dataset.mean(axis=(1,2)) → computes the mean across rows & columns, leaving one mean per timestep → shape (10,).\n\n# means[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis] reshapes (10,) → (10, 1, 1), so NumPy can broadcast it against (10, 5, 5).\n\n# Subtraction works per slice automatically.\n\n# After normalization, each 2D slice should have mean ≈ 0.\n\n\n# Original dataset shape: (10, 5, 5)\n# Means shape: (10,)\n# Normalized dataset shape: (10, 5, 5)\n# Means after normalization: [ 2.3e-15 -1.8e-15 ...]   # ~0 (numerical precision)",
